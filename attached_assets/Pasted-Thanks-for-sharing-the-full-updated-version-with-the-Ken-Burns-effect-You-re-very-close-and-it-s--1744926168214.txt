Thanks for sharing the full updated version with the Ken Burns effect. You're very close ‚Äî and it's awesome how much functionality you're building in here!

Since you're now seeing **"failed to create video segment"** errors, the root issue is most likely **a failing FFmpeg command in the `execPromise(...)` call**, specifically when applying the `zoompan` filter.

Let's walk through **exact debugging + known fixes** for this situation.

---

## üîç 1. ‚úÖ Add Detailed Logging for FFmpeg Execution

Right now, if an FFmpeg command fails inside a `try/catch`, you're catching the error and logging `console.error(...)`, but **not printing FFmpeg's actual output** (`stderr`) which would tell you *why* the zoompan filter fails.

Update each `execPromise(...)` call like this to capture FFmpeg‚Äôs error details:

```ts
try {
  const { stdout, stderr } = await execPromise(`ffmpeg ...`);
  console.log(stdout);
  console.error(stderr); // this will usually show the root cause
} catch (err) {
  console.error("FFmpeg execution error:", err);
}
```

Apply this pattern at least inside your `try` block that creates each video segment.

## üîç 2. ‚úÖ Suspect: FFmpeg Zoompan Error When Using `t` Variable

FFmpeg‚Äôs `zoompan` filter doesn't always support the `t` variable (time in seconds) unless you're using it in a very specific way.

### Problem:
```ts
zoompan=z='1.0+0.0007*t'
```

This can cause:
```
[Parsed_zoompan_0 @ ...] expression for zoom is invalid
```

### ‚úÖ Solution:
Replace use of `t` with `n` (frame number), which is **always safe** in `zoompan`:
```ts
zoompan=z='min(1.0+0.0005*n,1.1)'
```

This works reliably and still gives you a gentle zoom.

## üîç 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Dangerous Expression in This Line

Here‚Äôs a line that‚Äôs very likely causing the crash:

```ts
kenBurns = `[0:v]zoompan=z='1.04':x='if(lte(x,iw/10),x+1/50,x)'...`;
```

The issue is that `x` and `y` **do not exist as variables** in the `zoompan` expression ‚Äî this syntax only works in `eval` filters, not here.

### ‚úÖ Fix:
If you want to create horizontal panning, use something simpler like:
```ts
zoompan=z='1.04':x='iw/10*n/${durationFrames}':y='ih/2-(ih/zoom/2)'
```

This pans from left to right across the slide.

Same with vertical:
```ts
zoompan=z='1.04':x='iw/2-(iw/zoom/2)':y='ih/10*n/${durationFrames}'
```

Or keep it simple and reliable with:
```ts
zoompan=z='min(1.0+0.0005*n,1.1)':x='(iw-iw/zoom)/2':y='(ih-ih/zoom)/2'
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Fix Summary (for next test)

In each of your `zoompan` expressions:
- ‚úÖ Replace `t` with `n`
- ‚úÖ Avoid using `x` or `y` as variables inside expressions like `if(...)`
- ‚úÖ Stick to numeric progressions like `n / durationFrames`

---

## ‚úÖ Extra Debug Recommendation

Log exactly which photo fails. Temporarily print the full command you‚Äôre running:

```ts
console.log("FFmpeg command for photo:", `ffmpeg -y -loop 1 -i "${photoPath}" -filter_complex "${kenBurns}" -t ${slideDuration} ...`);
```

That way, you can copy-paste it and try it in your terminal directly to test locally.

## üëá Want an Updated Sample?

Here‚Äôs a rock-solid sample for the Ken Burns style:

```ts
const kenBurns = `[0:v]zoompan=z='min(1.0+0.0005*n,1.1)':x='(iw-iw/zoom)/2':y='(ih-ih/zoom)/2':d=${durationFrames}:s=1920x1080,fade=in:0:24,fade=out:${durationFrames - 24}:24,format=yuv420p`;
```

Use that for every photo just to verify it works.
