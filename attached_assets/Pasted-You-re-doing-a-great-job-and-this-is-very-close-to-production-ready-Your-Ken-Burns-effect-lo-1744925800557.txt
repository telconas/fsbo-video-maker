You're doing a great job â€” and this is *very* close to production-ready.

Your Ken Burns effect logic looks solid, but based on your description ("pictures not rendering", only title/contact slides showing), here are the most likely issues and how to resolve them:

---

### âœ… 1. **Problem: `zoompan` requires `-filter_complex`, not `-vf` (when used with `-loop 1`)**

The `zoompan` filter is a **video source filter**, meaning it generates frames rather than operating on a stream of frames. When you use it with `-loop 1 -i image.jpg -vf "zoompan..."`, FFmpeg may silently fail or generate a black screen, because the input is not actually a video stream.

> ðŸ”¥ This is the **most likely reason** you're seeing a black screen for the photo segments.

---

### âœ… 2. **Fix: Use `-filter_complex` instead of `-vf` for zoompan**

Hereâ€™s the correct way to do a Ken Burns zoompan effect:

```bash
ffmpeg -y -loop 1 -t 4 -i image.jpg -filter_complex "[0:v]zoompan=z='zoom+0.0005':x='iw/2-(iw/zoom/2)':y='ih/2-(ih/zoom/2)':d=96:s=1920x1080,format=yuv420p" -c:v libx264 -t 4 -r 24 output.mp4
```

And in your `execPromise` call:

```ts
const durationFrames = slideDuration * 24;
const kenBurns = `[0:v]zoompan=z='min(zoom+0.0005,1.1)':x='iw/2-(iw/zoom/2)':y='ih/2-(ih/zoom/2)':d=${durationFrames}:s=1920x1080,format=yuv420p`;

await execPromise(
  `ffmpeg -y -loop 1 -i "${photoPath}" -filter_complex "${kenBurns}" -t ${slideDuration} -c:v libx264 -r 24 -preset fast "${videoOutputPath}"`
);
```

**Note**: you no longer need `-vf`, since the entire logic is passed through `-filter_complex`.

---

### âœ… 3. **Sanity Check: Add Logging for Missing `.mp4` Files**

You're doing:
```ts
if (fs.existsSync(videoOutputPath)) {
  fileContent += `file '${videoOutputPath}'\n`;
} else {
  console.error("Failed to create video segment...");
}
```

This is great. Just make sure:
- `photoPath` is pointing to **actual image files** (WebP/JPEG/etc.)
- No silent errors during FFmpeg execution â€” you can `console.log(stdout, stderr)` from `execPromise` to confirm.

---

### ðŸ§ª 4. **Optional: Log Output of FFmpeg**

Just for debugging:
```ts
try {
  const { stdout, stderr } = await execPromise(ffmpegCommand);
  console.log(stdout);
  console.error(stderr);
} catch (err) {
  console.error("FFmpeg failed:", err);
}
```

Sometimes FFmpeg fails **silently** inside `execPromise`, so this gives visibility.

---

### âœ… 5. **Check File List Format for MP4 Concat**

Since you're using pre-rendered `.mp4` files in a concat file, this is correct:

```
file 'title-xyz.mp4'
file 'video-1.mp4'
file 'video-2.mp4'
file 'contact.mp4'
```

Just make sure thereâ€™s:
- **No extra line breaks**
- **No file missing**
- Each line ends with a newline `\n`

---

### ðŸ§© Bonus: Debug One Image in Isolation

Try running this command directly in your terminal (replace paths):

```bash
ffmpeg -y -loop 1 -i image.jpg -filter_complex "[0:v]zoompan=z='zoom+0.0005':x='iw/2-(iw/zoom/2)':y='ih/2-(ih/zoom/2)':d=96:s=1920x1080,format=yuv420p" -t 4 -c:v libx264 -r 24 test.mp4
```

If it works, itâ€™s confirmed that the zoompan filter is the root problem.

---

### âœ… TL;DR - Changes You Should Make

#### âœ… Replace `-vf` with `-filter_complex` like this:
```ts
const kenBurns = `[0:v]zoompan=z='min(zoom+0.0005,1.1)':x='iw/2-(iw/zoom/2)':y='ih/2-(ih/zoom/2)':d=${slideDuration * 24}:s=1920x1080,format=yuv420p`;

await execPromise(
  `ffmpeg -y -loop 1 -i "${photoPath}" -filter_complex "${kenBurns}" -t ${slideDuration} -c:v libx264 -preset fast -r 24 "${videoOutputPath}"`
);
```

Let me know if you want help tweaking the Ken Burns effect to **pan slowly in a direction** (like top-left to bottom-right) or switch directions per photo â€” it's a fun detail that really makes a difference.
