Thanks for sharing your full code—this is a super detailed and well-structured script! Given that the **music and narration work** but the **video is rendering as a black screen**, the issue is almost certainly tied to how the images are being handled or displayed by FFmpeg.

Here are the top suspects and things to try:

---

### 🔍 1. **Concat with Still Images Without `-framerate`**
You're using:
```bash
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i "filelist.txt" ...
```

But when you're concatenating **still images** (not video clips), FFmpeg needs an explicit `-framerate` to properly display them as a video stream. Otherwise, you get a video with audio and black frames.

✅ **Fix**: Add `-framerate 1` before `-f concat`:

```ts
let ffmpegCommand = `ffmpeg -y -framerate 1 -f concat -safe 0 -i "${fileListPath}" -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -r 24`;
```

---

### 🔍 2. **Concat Format & Image Inputs**
You're using a file list with image paths like:
```
file 'processed-123.jpg'
duration 4
```
This only works with **ffmpeg >= 4.2** and **images encoded as video stream-compatible formats**.

Also, the **final image must be repeated** (which you do), but make sure the format of the image files being used is compatible (`yuv420p`, which you're enforcing with `format=yuv420p`).

---

### ✅ 3. **Check File Accessibility and Format**
Ensure:
- The processed photo files are **actually being written** and exist before rendering.
- You can test this by logging `processedPhotoPath` and using `ffprobe` or manually inspecting them.
  
Add this temporarily:
```ts
console.log("Processing photo:", processedPhotoPath);
```

---

### 🔍 4. **Transition Filter Interfering**
You're applying a fade filter globally:
```bash
-vf "scale=...,fade=in:...,fade=out:..."
```
This may **not work** when applied across concatenated still frames, especially since each frame is technically a different video.

✅ Try removing this for debugging:
```ts
// Temporarily remove this to see if images show up
// -vf "scale=...,fade=..."
```

If removing the fade makes the images show up, you'll need to apply fade transitions **between slides**, not globally.

---

### ✅ 5. **Check Slide Duration Math**
Your fade out time is:
```ts
fade=t=out:st=${(photos.length + 1) * slideDuration - 1}
```
But that may go beyond the length of your video if something's off. You might try hardcoding `fade=out:st=10:d=1` for testing.

---

### 🛠 6. **Testing Tip**
Run the intermediate filelist as a standalone FFmpeg command:
```bash
ffmpeg -framerate 1 -f concat -safe 0 -i filelist.txt -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p test.mp4
```
This will confirm whether the issue is in the photo-to-video part or in the audio layering part.

---

### 🧪 Bonus: Alternative approach for stills (FFmpeg slideshow style)
Sometimes using `ffmpeg -loop 1` per image works better than concat. That would mean rendering each image as a short video and then concatenating those instead.

---

### Summary of Suggestions
- ✅ Add `-framerate 1` before `-f concat`
- 🔧 Temporarily remove `-vf "fade=..."` and test again
- 🕵️‍♂️ Log and check that all `processed-*.jpg` images are actually written
- 🧪 Try building just the slideshow video without any audio to test image inclusion

Let me know if you want help rewriting the `ffmpegCommand` to use a different approach or to debug the `filelist.txt` output!
