Thanks for dropping that error stack ‚Äî this reveals **two key issues**:

---

### üí• Primary Error:

```
Error uploading photo: TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'toString')
    at uploadPhoto (useVideoMaker.ts:153:40)
```

This line means somewhere in your `uploadPhoto` function, you're trying to call `.toString()` on something that‚Äôs `null`.

### üîç Most Likely Cause:

You're doing something like:

```ts
const fileExtension = file.name.split(".").pop().toString();
```

But if `file.name` is `null` or missing a dot, `.pop()` returns `undefined`, and then calling `.toString()` fails.

---

### ‚úÖ Fix That First:

Update your `uploadPhoto` code like this:

```ts
const extension = file?.name?.includes(".")
  ? file.name.split(".").pop() || ""
  : "";
```

Or safely:

```ts
const extension = String(file?.name?.split(".").pop() || "");
```

Also, validate that `file` is not `null`:

```ts
if (!file) {
  console.error("No file selected for upload");
  return;
}
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Secondary Warning (React Beautiful DnD):

```
Warning: Connect(Droppable): Support for defaultProps will be removed...
```

That‚Äôs just a future deprecation warning from `react-beautiful-dnd`. Not causing crashes ‚Äî you can ignore for now, or switch to [`@hello-pangea/dnd`](https://github.com/hello-pangea/dnd) if you want to stay current.

### üöß Final Thoughts

Your video generation failure is likely a **chain reaction** from the photo upload failing ‚Üí resulting in no images being available ‚Üí FFmpeg fails to create segments.

Once the upload issue is fixed, your `photos[]` array should populate correctly, and FFmpeg should get valid inputs to build with.

---

### ‚úÖ What to Do Now

1. **Fix the `toString()` on null in `uploadPhoto`.**
2. **Add a check that `photo.storedName` and `photoPath` are defined before you pass them into FFmpeg.**
3. Retry your video generation ‚Äî if it still fails, the `stderr` logging from FFmpeg (like I showed earlier) will now be meaningful.
